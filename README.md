# Helion
Ambilight clone for windows written in Rust, meant to be used with an Arduino running [LEDstream](https://github.com/adafruit/Adalight/tree/master/Arduino/LEDstream).

# Config
Helion uses configuration generated by [HyperCon](https://github.com/tvdzwan/hyperion/wiki/configuration).
Config must be located in the current working directory, which is same as where the .exe is located when not run from command line.

Notes about config sections:

* `Device`:
	* `Output`: Serial port to use, e.g. "COM2" on windows.

	* `Baudrate`: Rate to use when sending pixel buffer to Arduino, LEDstream expects this to be 115200.

	* `Type`: Not read, but must be one where `Output` and `Baudrate` fields exist.

* `Construction`: Led placement. Everything is read.

* `Image Process`: Led capture areas. Blackborder stuff not read.

* `Frame Grabber`:
	* `Width` and `Height`, **REQUIRED**: Determines to what resolution frame is resized when analyzing colors, smaller is faster. Works best if dimensions are divisors of the native resolution. If a field is 0, native resolution is used in that dimension.

	* `Interval`: How often to capture the frame. If no smoothing is enabled, this also decides LED refresh rate. FPS = 1/interval.

* `Smoothing`:
	* `Type`: Type of smoothing to use, currently only `Linear smoothing`, no direct plans to add anything else.

	* `Time [ms]`: The time constant to use when smoothing. Larger values gives slower transition.

		* `Linear Smoothing`: `"previous value" + ("value difference" * max("Frame time difference" / "Time constant", 1))`

	* `Update Freq. [Hz]`: How often to update LEDs. Should be higher than FPS of `Frame Grabber` -> `Interval`. When no new frame has been captured, just keep smoothing the colors to previous frame.


* `Colors`: Everything is read.

* `External`: There are no plans to add support for anything under this tab. The stuff here is really just for Raspberry Pis with XBMC and stuff.


# Building

```
cargo build --release
```


Only Windows is supported at this time, as dxgcap is Windows only and I have not yet added support for any linux screen capturing.
